# Hey! This is Priyaaa
I’m not revealing my name (a little mystery never hurts), but I started coding when I was 11 and it quickly became something I genuinely love doing. I discovered GitHub through my coding courses and joined just for fun, though I didn’t post much back then. Now, I’m finally sharing all the projects I’ve built over the years. I deleted my previous account after making several posting errors and decided to start over with a clearer vison and cleaner code.

# About this Repository
This repository has several games I’ve made over time. Some are fun, and some are just plain silly.  They’re all pretty simple, but each one helped me learn something new. I’m still figuring things out, so go easy on the judging. I’m just here to learn, experiment, and have a bit of fun with coding.
